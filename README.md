# What this project is about:

This was the Mobile Application part our graduation project for the year 2020.

The whole project is a Location-based Emergency System, where a user makes an SOS Request or gets help from fellow users on the application.

The whole idea is to automate the current Emergency System and allow other users to help each other when possible.
